Introduction
-------
The main repository for my 2nd grade in MIPT. 
It contains homeworks that were checked by Kostantin ```https://github.com/tilir```

Folders
----
1. ```Errors``` - convenient library for logging
2. ```OpenCL_Strings``` - finding patterns in the big string using GPU power
3. ```OpenCL_BitSort``` - sorting arrays using GPU power
4. ```Graph``` - Knut`s way for storing and using graph
5. ```Balanced_set``` - AVL tree with some extra data. Helps to be faster than std::set 
6. ```Language``` - ParaCL
7. ```Matrix``` - convenient 2D array with fast calculations of determinant 
8. ```LLVM``` - not done yet
9. ```LFU_Cache``` - first, the simplest project in ILAB
10. ```Intersections``` - geometry wrapper for finding intersections in triangles
11. ```Binary_Heap``` - attempt to solve 2nd level in branch, called trees
